# Text_Indexer
Returns the indexes of a piece of text the user enters. Does this by comparing 2 lines: the text to compare and the text to compare to.

The application is run from the 'App.java' class. When this is done the console will prompt the user to enter the text (to be compared to)
followed by Enter.

Once this is done the console will prompt the user to enter the text to be compared, followed by enter.

Once they are both done an arraylist of the index positions will be returned and the text and index positions printed to the console. The
first position is '1' not '0'.

Example Input:

"Enter your TEXT here followed by Enter:"
12321178921

"Enter your SUBTEXT here followed by Enter:"
1

Example Output:

Subtext: 1	 Positions: [1, 5, 6, 11]
